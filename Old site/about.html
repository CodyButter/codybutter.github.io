            <h4>The Boy Called Butter</h4>
            <p>This is the tale of a 13 year old boy. The summer of 2013 was coming to an end. He was going to start high school that year and he decided that he wanted to have a fresh start at this new school. He had no idea what he could do. Then came the first day of school, he did nothing that would make him stand out. That was until after lunch, his teacher literally said that that she would call people by their nickname. He simply said "Call me Butter". Then that what everybody started calling him.</p> 
            <h4></h4>
            <p>A few months later, he found himself a new friend in the lunchroom, he was playing a game on his school laptop. With his interest peaked, he aproached the boy and asked him about the game. The told him that he made it himself and he showed him the program he used to make the game. Butter made a true friend that day, his name was Draven. He would later give Butter the program to try and make a game for himself. He eventually did make a game, it was not the best, but it was a game nonetheless. Draven was impressed, he told him to keep practicing and he would get better. The next year, Butter would begin programming. He was not the best, but he was improving. He was talking with his friend Draven and told him about his idea. Infinite Strike, he wanted to make games for a living. Then he asked if Butter wanted to join. He agreed. And here we are today, the business is going and there are no plans of stopping now. Infinite Strike is more then a business, its a way of life. </p>
